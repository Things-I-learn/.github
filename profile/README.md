# Welcome to My Learning Hub!

👨‍💻 **I am a self-taught computer scientist** on a journey to expand my knowledge in various fields of computer science. I created this organization to encapsulate all the valuable resources and repositories where I am learning something new.

💡 **Why separate from my personal account?**  
In my personal account, I prefer to host projects that are either contributable or at least reproducible for others. This space is dedicated to my learning process, allowing me to share insights, resources, and projects that reflect my growth.
